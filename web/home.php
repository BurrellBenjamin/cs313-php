            <p>My name is Ben Burrell. I live with my wife and puppy, and I
                enjoy playing video games. My favorite game is Pokemon, and
                I'm in the midst of starting up my own competitive Draft League.
                (details forthcoming). Two of my personal favorite Pokemon to play
                with are Claydol and Dusclops, because they both have high defenses.

            <p>Competitive Pokemon might seem like a silly idea to the uninitiated,
                but those people haven't seen the math behind the game's primary
                mechanics. This handy equation below calculates the damage that a
                given (damaging) move does, with a little random number variation
                for extra fun and frustration.

            <br>
            <p>Math aside, the sheer volume of critical thinking that goes into
                competitive Pokemon is staggering enough to convince scoffers of
                the validity of the term. If you still want proof, I'd invite you
                to watch this video where a Pokemon Youtuber legitimately takes
                30 minutes to plan for his match.
